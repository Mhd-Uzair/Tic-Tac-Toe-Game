# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
# Introduction
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with their symbol: either X or O. The objective is to be the first player to align three of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

# How to Play
# Players:
Two players take turns to play.
Player 1 uses X.
Player 2 uses O.

# Game Board:
The game board consists of a 3x3 grid (9 squares).
Players mark one square per turn with their symbol.

# Winning the Game:
A player wins by placing three of their symbols in a:
Horizontal row.
Vertical column.
Diagonal line.
If all squares are filled and no player has aligned three symbols, the game ends in a draw.

# How to Play the Game:
Players take turns selecting an empty square on the grid to place their symbol.
The game continues until one player wins or the board is full.
